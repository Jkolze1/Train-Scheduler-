# Train-Scheduler <br>
This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. Build with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, and Firebase.
